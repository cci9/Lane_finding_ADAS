# Lane_finding_ADAS

Welcome to the ADAS world. Where your vehicle will take all decision while driving and provides you Safety with Comfort.

In this repository I have added my code, which automatically detects the road lane from the recorded video using Convolution Neural Network based algorithm.
For writing this code I have used Python programming language and I have explored my-self with Keras, Open CV, Matplotlib libraries.

This lane detection feauture is the part Lateral Component of the ADAS features which involves LKA and LCA sub-components.
This implementation can be converted to use for continious monitoring on road by taking data from different sensors when vehicle is moving.
